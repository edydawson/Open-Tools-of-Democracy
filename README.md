# Open-Tools-of-Democracy
Fairness for the masses.

## What is this?
This aim to be a collection of open source tool and open protocol for all parts participating in a democracy.
Based on its origin, the United States of America. This isn't a partisan, but a toolset for all.

The point is fairness.

Leave the government to run itself, but the public needs fairness to properly be represented locally and nationally.

We the people. The rest is politics.

I propose fairness needs Truth,Trust, and the willingness to Communicate.

In the US we have

* executive
* congressional
* judicial
* reporters
* the people

It is time the people have the tools to trust the truth these estates of our society so we can discuss what is fair.

The internet may allow for this to happen and I believe developers of the world can help make these tools become reality. 

I think these tools should be open-source and the protocols be open and interoperable so different tools can communicate. A lot of work has already been done in the open source world, but it is time for that world to work on politics. 

# Please fork
Write your ideas, add your tools, do what ever you want.
The more is spreads the more total spare time devs will have to work on it.

# A test case
